🥦 Food Desert Analysis Across the United States

This project explores the distribution, severity, and key socio-economic drivers of food deserts in the United States using the USDA's Food Research Atlas and Food Environment Atlas datasets. Through in-depth data analysis, visualization, and machine learning models, we identify high-risk regions and propose actionable solutions for improving food accessibility and reducing nutritional inequality.

📁 Project Structure

- 📊 Data Exploration & Visualization
- 🧠 Predictive Modeling (Classification & Regression)
- 🧪 Statistical Testing (T-tests, Correlation Analysis)
- 📈 Policy Recommendations & Regional Insights

🧾 Datasets Used

- Food Access Research Atlas (2019)  
  Provided by the USDA. Includes tract-level information on low-income and low-access areas.

- Food Environment Atlas  
  County-level indicators of food choices, health outcomes, and community characteristics.

---

🧪 Modeling

- Classification Model:
  - Type: Random Forest Classifier
  - Goal: Predict whether a tract is a food desert (binary)
  - Accuracy: 95%
  - Key Features: Poverty rate, median income, SNAP, vehicle access

- Regression Model:
  - Type: Random Forest Regressor
  - Goal: Predict number of SNAP households
  - R² Score: 0.9458
  - Key Features: Household income, grocery distance, vehicle availability

---

📌 Key Insights

- Poverty, vehicle inaccessibility, and SNAP participation strongly correlate with food desert severity.
- The Southeast region (e.g., Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana) faces the highest food desert burden.
- Even SNAP households in food deserts often face geographic barriers to healthy food access.

🧩 Solutions Proposed

- Government Investment in Infrastructure & Transportation
- Policy Reform for Food Retail Incentives in Underserved Areas
- SNAP Expansion & Distribution Efficiency
- Community-Based Interventions & Local Food Systems
- Predictive Modeling to Identify At-Risk Regions
